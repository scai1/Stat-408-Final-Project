Introduction

As someone pursuing a masters in applied statistics with the goal of a career change, it is an intriguing to question the career opportunities available after finishing this degree. 
What kind of salary and compensation can one expect if pursuing a career in data science/data analyst,etc? 
For this final project, I am considering a ds_salaries dataset which tracks the salaries of n= 3755 data science related careers from the years 2020-2023. 
I hope to get a general sense of the salaries and compensation expectations of data science related careers. Additionally, I hope to answer questions such as which factors/attributes are significant contributors to overall salary? 
What is the best model from among the dataset's variables that best explains salary expectations? On a surface level, are there are any predictors in the intial dataset that are redundant or collinear?  

To approach this problem, I am dividing this report into these sections:

1. Data Exploration and Preparation.  
2. Model Building+ Selection
3. Model refinement (Identifying outliers and checking influenceplots)
4. Interpretation of Results 
5. Evaluation and discussion.
